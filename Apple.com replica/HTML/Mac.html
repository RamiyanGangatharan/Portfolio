                Supercharged by M2 Pro or M2 Max, MacBook Pro takes its power and efficiency further than ever.
                It delivers exceptional performance whether it’s plugged in or not, and now has even longer battery life.
                Combined with a stunning Liquid Retina XDR display and all the ports you need 
                — this is a pro laptop without equal.
                Introducing the next generation of Apple silicon for pros: the lightning-fast M2 Pro and the extraordinary M2 Max
                — the most powerful and efficient chip ever in a pro laptop.
                <br><br>
                M2 Pro brings power to take on even more demanding projects.
                The up to 12‑core CPU and next‑generation Neural Engine make pro workflows fly
                — from sorting and editing thousands of images to running computational fluid
                dynamics simulations. And the up to 19‑core GPU drives a huge boost in graphics
                performance for both work and play.The most powerful and efficient chip ever
                in a pro laptop, M2 Max is engineered to help pros push the boundaries of their
                ingenuity and creativity. With the same next‑generation 12‑core CPU as M2 Pro, 
                M2 Max has twice the memory bandwidth, up to three times the unified memory 
                and up to 38 GPU cores. So you can render effects, merge massive panoramas 
                and design extreme 3D geometry on an unprecedented scale.
                <br><br>
                MacBook Pro is available in 14 and 16 inch models. Each can be configured with
                the M2 Pro or M2 Max chip and offers next-level pro performance in a laptop.
                The 16‑inch model has the longest battery life ever in a Mac. And both models
                remain just as fast whether on the battery or plugged in. That efficiency is
                the magic of Apple silicon. So wherever inspiration strikes or whenever duty
                calls, run with it. The coolest part. Thanks to the efficiency of Apple silicon,
                the fans don’t even have to turn on for most of your daily tasks. And for heavier
                workflows, the advanced thermal systems move air at low fan speeds.
                <br><br>
                Think huge. MacBook Pro is built on an all-flash storage architecture designed to make 
                everyday tasks snappy and responsive. For demanding workflows with large files, 
                configurations up to 8TB deliver even more performance. macOS Ventura was designed
                to maximize the capabilities of Apple silicon. So your go-to pro apps run faster,
                and multitasking is smoother than ever. With over 15,000 optimized apps and plug‑ins
                — and powerful new macOS features like Stage Manager — you can work smarter, play
                harder and go further.
                <br><br>
                Liquid Retina XDR. Extreme Dynamic Range brings refined specular highlights,
                incredible detail in shadows, and vibrant, true‑to‑life colours. Each display
                is calibrated in the factory and features pro reference modes for HDR colour
                grading, photography, design and print production. ProMotion. Making everything
                from scrolling to gaming superfluid and responsive, ProMotion automatically
                adjusts to match the movement of content — with refresh rates up to 120Hz.
                Video editors can also choose a fixed refresh rate that precisely aligns with
                their footage.
                <br><br>
                Look sharp wherever you make or take video calls — whether you’re connecting 
                with friends and family across time zones or collaborating with colleagues 
                out in the field. The 1080p camera uses a wide aperture to let in more light, 
                combined with a large image sensor for better performance in low light.
                Studio‑quality three-mic array. With a signal-to-noise ratio that rivals
                professional-grade microphones, MacBook Pro can capture even the subtlest
                sounds. And directional beamforming minimizes background noise so your voice
                comes through loud and clear. Six-speaker sound system. Four force‑cancelling
                woofers deliver deeper bass and room‑filling sound. High-performance tweeters 
                project clearer, fuller vocals. And Spatial Audio creates a sophisticated 
                three-dimensional soundstage when you’re playing music or video with Dolby Atmos.

                Transfer photos and videos with an SDXC card reader. Connect to TVs or displays

                with Wi‑Fi 6E.
                <br><br>
                The Magic Keyboard comes with a full-height function key row and Touch ID,
                which gives you a fast, easy, secure way to unlock your Mac and sign in to apps and sites.
